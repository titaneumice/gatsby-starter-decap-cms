#####        Header        #####
Story |  Feed/Variable  |  Archive
Nav   |     Content     | (filters automatically)
---------------------------------
A filtered feed, on some pages
#####        Footer        #####


Main Page's primary content is an unfiltered feed.

Archive page is posts sans content, ideally with thumbnails if images are available -
    allowing it to be like a gallery. Idea: Images and text-only separated? Or option to sort like this.

Story nav primary page. Wouldn't need feed or archive, so wouldn't follow default layout -
    maybe could follow post format?
